# Audio-Mixer

Project to compete and provide an alternative to voice meeter, by providing a modern audio mixer solution for Windows, MacOS, and Linux with easy expandability of features and functionality.

# Project Proposal

The proposed project involves the creation of a new audio mixer/audio routing application that will provide an alternative option to Voicemeeter (Voicemeeter potato). The proposed application will provide a modern alternative to Voicemeeter with improved flexibility and extendibility, with the potential of becoming an open-source project if successful and requested enough by the user base of the application/project. The project will be very similar to the Voicemeeter application but with improvements related to the flexibility and extendibility of the application (e.g. Supporting unlimited virtual inputs, hardware inputs, and hardware outputs). Further information and feature-specific details will be provided throughout this project, either using the README file, Github wiki or as part of the issue requests (but for feature-specific requests).


# Reason for the project proposal

Currently, voice meeter is the only product on the market (using the donationware model) where it provides an easy option for none technical users to mix and configure audio routing paths between different applications within the Windows operating system. This project and project proposal is an attempt to provide an alternative option to voice meeter and hopefully provide competition in the market, where advancements in software audio mixers will occur and continue to provide options to users.

# Current limitations & issues with Voicemeeter

1). Supports only the Windows operating systems

2). Lack of flexibility and extendibility overall with both the audio mixer application and audio device drivers.

3). Technical bugs/issues which make it difficult for everyone (including none technical users).

# Project Components

1). Audio Device Driver (Virtual Audio Cable).

2). Audio Mixer / Routing Application (Similar to Voicemeeter Potato application).

3). Plugin engine (Supporting VST3, AAX, etc).

3). Installation Wizzard for both the audio device driver, audio mixer/routing application, and the plugin engine.
