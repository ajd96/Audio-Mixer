# Audio-Mixer
Project to compete and provide a alternative to voicemeeter, by providing a modern audio mixer solution for Windows, MacOS and Linux with easy expandability of features and functionality.

# Project Proposal


# Reason of the project proposal

Currently voicemeeter is the only product on the market (using donation ware model) where it provides an easy option for none technical users to mix and configure audio routing paths between different applications within the Windows operating system. This project and project proposal is an attempt to provide a alternative option to voicemeeter and hopefully provide competition in the market, where advancements in software audio mixers will occur and continue to provide options to users.

# Current limitations & issues with Voicemeeter

1). Supports only the Windows operating systems

2). Lack of flexibility and extendibility overall with both the audio mixer application and audio device drivers.

3). Technical bugs / issues which make it difficult for everyone (including none technical users).

# Project Componments

1). Audio Device Driver (Virtual Audio Cable)

2). Audio Mixer / Routing Application (Similar to Voicemeeter Patato application)

3). Installation Wizzard for both the audio device driver and audio mixer / routing application
